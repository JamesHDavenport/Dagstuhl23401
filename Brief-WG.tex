Formal Verification of Computer Algebra
(James H. Davenport, Edgar Costa, Alex J. Best, Mario Carneiro)

Of the problems listed by Davenport (CICM 2023 and talk here) we chose polynomial factorisation as having least mathematical pre-requisites.
For computer algebra, we took FLINT as an easy-to access library of algorithms (specifically factor_Zassenhaus).
As proof engine we took LEAN (familiarity).
We have realised what we need as a certificate, seen that we can extract these data from FLINT (but could FLINT do a little more work to make the
verification easier), and have started formalising the required statements in LEAN.
This has also led to identification of improvements to LEAN, and research questions in computer algebra.
We are continuing to develop this ideas, in Davenport's case as a challenge to his students' LEAN study group.
